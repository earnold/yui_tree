Version 1.10, 2010-01-29
========================

Updating to this version is a little more complex than in previous releases
because a support JavaScript file, exported into your application's "public"
directory, has been changed too. First use the usual plugin update mechanism:

  script/plugin update yui_tree

If you have not made any changes to the YUI tree JavaScript code in this file:

  public/javascripts/yui_tree/yui_tree_support.js

...then you can now overwrite this with the updated version by issuing this
command from the root of your Rails application:

  ruby vendor/plugins/yui_tree/update.rb

...and your update is complete. If you did make your own changes to the YUI
tree support script, though, you will need to merge the changes by hand. The
updated plug-in's master copy of the script is held at:

  vendor/plugins/yui_tree/lib/yui_tree/resources/javascripts/yui_tree/yui_tree_support.js

Changes since the previous version:

- Fixed name field text shown when a tree has nothing selected but has a
  'none' string defined via the :include_blank option. Previously the given
  text would only be shown if the user explicitly selected the tree's "none"
  entry but not if the tree was shown for a resource where "none" applied
  already (it always just used a blank string in this initial startup case).

- Fixed silly mistake causing a failure to update the name field text of an
  item selected in the root of the tree. The root nodes were being added
  *before* the event handlers for changes of highlight were installed.

- By request, added new :multi_expand option. Fully backwards compatible
  with existing code. Normally a multiple selection tree allows multiple
  nodes (branches) to open concurrently. A single selection tree only allows
  one node (branch) to be open at a time. The multi_expand property can be
  set to true or false to override this behaviour. The most obvious use is
  to allow multiple branches of a single-selection tree to be concurrently
  open. Setting the :multiple and :multi_expand options to the same value or
  omitting the :multi_expand option altogether produces the same behaviour
  as in previous versions of the plug-in.


Version 1.02, 2010-01-23
========================

To update to this version, use the usual plugin update mechanism:

  script/plugin update yui_tree

Changes since the previous version:

- Exclude, expand or highlight lists now unlikely to be confused by
  String or Fixnum objects which respond to "id". Stops accidental
  misinterpretation of literally provided IDs as ActiveRecord
  objects, leading to the incorrect calling of "id", in certain
  circumstances.

- Minor comment error fixed; documentation updated.


Version 1.01, 2009-12-14
========================

To update to this version, use the usual plugin update mechanism:

  script/plugin update yui_tree

Changes since the previous version:

- Fixes ambiguity regarding data types for IDs in exclude, expand and
  highlight lists and makes the JavaScript comparison thereof more resilient
  to variations by coercing values to strings for comparison.


Version 1.00, 2009-12-09
========================

- First public release.
