Version 1.02, 2010-01-23
========================

To update to this version, use the usual plugin update mechanism:

  script/plugin update yui_tree

Changes since the previous version:

- Exclude, expand or highlight lists now unlikely to be confused by
  String or Fixnum objects which respond to "id". Stops accidental
  misinterpretation of literally provided IDs as ActiveRecord
  objects, leading to the incorrect calling of "id", in certain
  circumstances.

- Minor comment error fixed; documentation updated.


Version 1.01, 2009-12-14
========================

To update to this version, use the usual plugin update mechanism:

  script/plugin update yui_tree

Changes since the previous version:

- Fixes ambiguity regarding data types for IDs in exclude, expand and
  highlight lists and makes the JavaScript comparison thereof more resilient
  to variations by coercing values to strings for comparison.


Version 1.00, 2009-12-09
========================

- First public release.
